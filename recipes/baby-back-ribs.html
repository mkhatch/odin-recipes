<h2>Perfect Ribs, No Grill Needed</h2>
<p>Smoky, sweet, sticky, and savory—these baby 
back ribs taste just like the ones from your 
favorite BBQ joint, only you can make them right 
at home. They’re generously seasoned with a 
homemade spice rub, cooked low and slow until t
ender and juicy, then slathered with barbecue sauce 
and finished until the outside forms a flavorful 
bark.</p>

<p>I’ll walk you through how to make them whether 
you’ve got a smoker, an oven, or want to start 
them inside and finish on the grill. However you 
cook them, these ribs are seriously good and 
surprisingly easy.
</p>

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
<li>3 tablespoons sugar</li>
<li>2 teaspoons salt</li>
<li>1½ tablespoons smoked paprika</li>
<li>1½ teaspoons garlic powder</li>
<li>1½ teaspoons onion powder</li>
<li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
<li>½ teaspoon ground mustard</li>
<li>2 racks baby back ribs</li>
<li>About 6 tablespoons homemade or store-bought BBQ sauce, 
plus more for serving</li>
</ul>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Make the Spice Rub: In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, salt, smoked paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, cumin, oregano, ground mustard, and cayenne pepper.</li>
    <li>Preheat the oven to 300°F (150°C). Set one rack in the middle position and one rack in the top position.</li>
    <li>Remove the membrane that coats the underside of each rack of ribs: Using a butter knife, loosen the membrane around one of the end bones, scraping it away from the ribs. Once you get under it, grab the membrane with a paper towel and peel it off. If you’re lucky, it will come off all in one piece. (Alternatively, ask your butcher to do this for you.)</li>
    <li>Coat the ribs evenly on both sides with about half of the spice rub. Allow the ribs to sit for about 15 minutes to "sweat" and absorb the rub, then coat the racks with the remainder of the rub. It will seem like too much rub but it's not – use it all.</li>
    <li>Line a baking sheet with heavy-duty aluminum foil. Place the spice-coated ribs on the prepared pan, cover the pan tightly with foil, and bake until tender, about 2 hours. Turn the oven to broil. Remove the foil from the ribs and brush each rack with 3 tablespoons of the barbecue sauce. Broil until the sauce just starts to bubble and caramelize, 2 to 4 minutes. Keep a close eye on the ribs while they're under the broiler; because of the sugar in the rub and sauce, they will quickly go from nicely caramelized to burnt. (Alternatively, you can skip the broiling and finish the ribs on the grill. Preheat the grill to medium and grill the baked racks for 10 to 15 minutes, brushing occasionally with the BBQ sauce until charred in spots and heated through. Adjust heat as necessary to prevent burning.) Let the ribs cool for about 10 minutes, then slice and serve.</li>
